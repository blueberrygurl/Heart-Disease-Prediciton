##  Project Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging clinical and demographic data, the project demonstrates preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation to classify individuals at risk.

---

##  Features

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and normalizing key features using `StandardScaler`.
   - Handling numerical and categorical data effectively.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing distributions and relationships between variables.
   - Identifying correlations and feature importance.

3. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implementation of classification algorithms, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Decision Trees
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Confusion matrices, feature importance plots, and performance comparisons.
